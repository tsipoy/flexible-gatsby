This Country Quiz App is an app build on react hooks. This app was build to train us to be familiar of using react hooks. It is really nice app because we covered many things inside such us using useState and useEffect. Yet, we didn’t use reducer as it is still the first react app that we have created. In this app, we have two random questions which are asking the users for the a capital of a country and a picture of a flag in which a country belongs to. We have four random buttons for the user to choose the country capital as well as the flag. When the users get a right answer, they are still able to continue, the game but once they get it wrong, they can see their scores. Additionally, they can still try again. That’s all about this app but if want to got further. You can visit this live app. [Country Quiz](https://natacha-country-quiz.netlify.app/)
