This is a photograph project based on HTML and SASS. It was built to help us to understand html semantics by adding sass. It also helped us to understand more about css variables. Even though this project is based on html and sass, we add a bit of javascript to make it nicer. So, in terms of making the images change when the user clicks on the small images we add the javascript. Additionally, we learned to optimize images in this project as it used more images in it using tiny.jpg which can prevent the page from loading so long.
